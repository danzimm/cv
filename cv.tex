\section{Research}

\combosection{Asymptotic Limits of Nonlocal Curvature for Curves}{LUC (B. Seguin)}{2023 - Present}{
  \begin{tightlist}
    \item
      Analyzing asymptotic limits of nonlocal curvature functionals for curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$, establishing convergence to classical curvature under appropriate scaling. Derived explicit asymptotics for circles and used geometric properties of canal surfaces to show that the nonlocal curvature of an arbitrary curve can be locally approximated by that of a circle.
    \item
      Presented at the AMS Sectional Meeting on Nonlocal Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory (Albany, 2024).
    \item
      {\italic Manuscript in preparation.}
  \end{tightlist}
}

\combosection{Supernova Photometric Contamination Studies}{ANL (S. Kuhlmann, J. Cunningham)}{2013 - 2015}{
\begin{tightlist}
\item
  Investigated contamination of photometrically-selected Type Ia supernova samples by core-collapse supernovae using SNANA simulations and SALT2 parameter-space selection. Identified misclassified SNcc events and applied SNCosmo template-fitting to show that expanding the SNcc template set reduces false-Ia identifications by \~30\% per iteration.
\item
  Presented at NCUR (2014), CAURS (2015), and AAS 225 (2015).
