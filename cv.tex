\section{Research}

\combosection{Asymptotic Limits of Nonlocal Curvature for Curves}{LUC (B. Seguin)}{2023 - Present}{
  \begin{tightlist}
    \item
      Proved classical curvature is recovered under appropriate asymptotic analysis of nonlocal curvature of sufficiently \\ regular curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
    \item
      Derived explicit asymptotics for circles and used geometric properties of canal surfaces to show that the nonlocal \\ curvature of an arbitrary curve can be locally approximated by that of a circle.
    \item
      Presented at the AMS Sectional Meeting on Nonlocal Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory (Albany, 2024).
    \item
      {\italic Manuscript in preparation.}
  \end{tightlist}

\combosection{Supernova Photometric Contamination Studies}{ANL (S. Kuhlmann, J. Cunningham)}{2013 - 2015}{
\begin{tightlist}
\item
  Reduced false-positive Type Ia identifications by \textasciitilde 30\%.
\item
  Investigated contamination of photometrically-selected Type Ia supernova samples by core-collapse supernovae using SNANA simulations and SALT2 parameter-space selection. Identified misclassified SNcc events and applied SNCosmo template-fitting with various characteristic lightcurves.
\item
  Presented at NCUR (2014), CAURS (2015), and AAS 225 (2015).
